# Project: Malware Analysis and Containment

## Introduction
Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behavior and purpose of a suspicious file or URL. This project aims to equip you with the skills to analyze malware, understand its behavior, and take appropriate containment measures.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic knowledge of malware types
- Familiarity with computer systems
- Basic understanding of virtual machines

## Lab Set-up and Tools
- Virtual machines (VMs) for a safe analysis environment
- Malware samples
- Analysis tools (e.g., Wireshark, Process Explorer, PEiD)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment
**Objective**: Learn to set up a secure environment to safely analyze malware.

**Steps**:
1. Install and configure a virtual machine (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware).
2. Ensure the VM is isolated from the host machine and network.
3. Set up snapshot functionality to revert to a clean state after analysis.

**Expected Output**:
- A fully configured virtual machine ready for malware analysis.

### Exercise 2: Static Analysis of Malware Samples
**Objective**: Perform static analysis on malware samples to gather information without executing them.

**Steps**:
1. Download a malware sample (provided by the instructor).
2. Use tools like PEiD to identify the type and packer of the malware.
3. Analyze the file's metadata, strings, and imports using tools like Strings and Dependency Walker.

**Expected Output**:
- A report detailing the findings from the static analysis, including the file type, packer, and any interesting strings or imports.

### Exercise 3: Dynamic Analysis of Malware Behavior
**Objective**: Execute the malware in a controlled environment and observe its behavior.

**Steps**:
1. Revert the VM to the clean snapshot created in Exercise 1.
2. Run the malware sample in the VM.
3. Use tools like Process Explorer and Wireshark to monitor the malware's behavior, including file changes, network activity, and registry modifications.

**Expected Output**:
- A detailed report on the malware's behavior, including screenshots and descriptions of observed activities.

### Exercise 4: Containing the Malware Spread
**Objective**: Learn how to contain and mitigate the impact of malware on an infected system.

**Steps**:
1. Identify and document the persistence mechanisms used by the malware (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks).
2. Remove or neutralize these persistence mechanisms.
3. Use anti-malware tools to clean the system and ensure all traces of the malware are removed.
4. Document the containment and remediation steps.

**Expected Output**:
- A report detailing the containment and remediation steps taken to clean the infected system.
