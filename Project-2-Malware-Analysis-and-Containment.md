# Project: Malware Analysis and Containment

## Introduction
Malware analysis is the process of understanding the behavior and purpose of a suspicious file or URL. This project aims to equip you with the skills to analyze malware, understand its behavior, and take appropriate containment measures.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic knowledge of malware types
- Familiarity with computer systems
- Basic understanding of virtual machines

## Lab Set-up and Tools

To analyze and contain malware, you need a controlled environment that ensures your main system remains unaffected. Here’s a detailed setup:

### 1. Virtual Machines (VMs)
**Description**: VMs provide an isolated environment where malware can be safely executed and analyzed.

**Tools**: 
- **VirtualBox**: Open-source virtualization software by Oracle.
- **VMware Workstation Player**: A free virtualization tool by VMware.

### 2. Malware Samples
**Description**: Obtain malware samples for analysis. Ensure they are sourced from reputable repositories and handled with care.

**Tools**:
- **VirusShare**: A large repository of malware samples.
- **MalwareBazaar**: A project from abuse.ch aimed at sharing malware samples.

### 3. Analysis Tools
- **Wireshark**: A network protocol analyzer that captures and interacts with network traffic in real-time.
- **Process Explorer**: An advanced process management tool from Microsoft’s Sysinternals suite.
- **PEiD**: A tool to detect the packer or compiler used to create executable files.

## Setting Up the Lab Environment

### 1. Install VirtualBox or VMware Workstation Player
- Download and install VirtualBox from the [official website](https://www.virtualbox.org/).
- Alternatively, download VMware Workstation Player from the [official website](https://www.vmware.com/products/workstation-player.html).

### 2. Create and Configure a Virtual Machine
- Create a new virtual machine and install an operating system (e.g., Windows 10).
- Configure network settings to ensure the VM is isolated from the host network. Use a host-only adapter or disconnect the network adapter.

### 3. Set Up Snapshot Functionality
- In VirtualBox, create a snapshot by navigating to **Machine > Take Snapshot**.
- In VMware, create a snapshot by navigating to **VM > Snapshot > Take Snapshot**.

### 4. Obtain Malware Samples
- Download samples from VirusShare or MalwareBazaar.
- Store the samples in a secure, encrypted archive until ready for analysis.

### 5. Install and Configure Analysis Tools
- **Wireshark**: Download and install from the [official website](https://www.wireshark.org).
- **Process Explorer**: Download from the [Microsoft Sysinternals website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/process-explorer).
- **PEiD**: Download from a trusted source and install.

### 6. Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment
- Ensure the VM is up to date with the latest patches.
- Install any additional monitoring tools, such as RegShot for registry snapshots and Autoruns for startup monitoring.


## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Setting Up a Safe Analysis Environment
**Objective**: Learn to set up a secure environment to safely analyze malware.

**Steps**:
1. Install and configure a virtual machine (e.g., VirtualBox or VMware).
2. Ensure the VM is isolated from the host machine and network.
3. Set up snapshot functionality to revert to a clean state after analysis.

**Expected Output**:
- A fully configured virtual machine ready for malware analysis.

### Exercise 2: Static Analysis of Malware Samples
**Objective**: Perform static analysis on malware samples to gather information without executing them.

**Steps**:
1. Download a malware sample (provided by the instructor).
2. Use tools like PEiD to identify the type and packer of the malware.
3. Analyze the file's metadata, strings, and imports using tools like Strings and Dependency Walker.

**Expected Output**:
- A report detailing the findings from the static analysis, including the file type, packer, and any interesting strings or imports.

### Exercise 3: Dynamic Analysis of Malware Behavior
**Objective**: Execute the malware in a controlled environment and observe its behavior.

**Steps**:
1. Revert the VM to the clean snapshot created in Exercise 1.
2. Run the malware sample in the VM.
3. Use tools like Process Explorer and Wireshark to monitor the malware's behavior, including file changes, network activity, and registry modifications.

**Expected Output**:
- A detailed report on the malware's behavior, including screenshots and descriptions of observed activities.

### Exercise 4: Containing the Malware Spread
**Objective**: Learn how to contain and mitigate the impact of malware on an infected system.

**Steps**:
1. Identify and document the persistence mechanisms used by the malware (e.g., registry keys, scheduled tasks).
2. Remove or neutralize these persistence mechanisms.
3. Use anti-malware tools to clean the system and ensure all traces of the malware are removed.
4. Document the containment and remediation steps.

**Expected Output**:
- A report detailing the containment and remediation steps taken to clean the infected system.
