# Project: Phishing Attack Investigation

## Introduction
Phishing attacks are a prevalent cybersecurity threat where attackers deceive individuals into providing sensitive information by masquerading as a trustworthy entity. This project aims to equip you with the skills to identify, investigate, and respond to phishing attacks effectively.

## Pre-requisites
- Basic understanding of email systems
- Familiarity with phishing techniques
- Basic knowledge of email analysis tools

## Lab Set-up and Tools
- Email server simulation
- Phishing email samples
- Email analysis tools (e.g., Thunderbird, PhishTool)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Identifying Phishing Emails
**Objective**: Learn to recognize phishing emails based on common characteristics.

**Steps**:
1. Set up your email analysis environment using Thunderbird.
2. Load the provided phishing email samples into Thunderbird.
3. Identify and document common phishing indicators (e.g., suspicious sender address, generic greetings, urgent language, suspicious links).

**Expected Output**:
- A list of identified phishing emails with documented indicators.

### Exercise 2: Analyzing Email Headers
**Objective**: Understand how to analyze email headers to uncover information about the email's origin.

**Steps**:
1. Select a phishing email from Exercise 1.
2. Open the email header information in Thunderbird.
3. Analyze the header to identify:
   - Sender's IP address
   - Email servers the email passed through
   - Any discrepancies in the sender's information

**Expected Output**:
- A detailed report on the email header analysis with identified IP addresses and server information.

### Exercise 3: Investigating Suspicious Links
**Objective**: Learn to investigate suspicious links in phishing emails without compromising your system.

**Steps**:
1. Identify suspicious links in the phishing emails from Exercise 1.
2. Use a URL analysis tool (e.g., VirusTotal, PhishTool) to investigate the links.
3. Document the findings, including the risk level and any associated malicious activity.

**Expected Output**:
- A report detailing the analysis of each suspicious link, including screenshots and risk assessments.

### Exercise 4: Reporting and Documenting the Phishing Attempt
**Objective**: Create a comprehensive report of the phishing investigation.

**Steps**:
1. Compile findings from Exercises 1-3 into a single report.
2. Include the following sections:
   - Executive summary
   - Detailed analysis of phishing emails
   - Email header analysis
   - Suspicious link investigation
   - Recommendations for preventing future phishing attacks
3. Present the report in a clear and professional format.

**Expected Output**:
- A comprehensive phishing investigation report ready for presentation to stakeholders.
